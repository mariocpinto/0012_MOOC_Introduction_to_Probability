### Lecture 5: Probability Mass Functions and Expectations

* Overview

* [Definition of Random Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2f743SpPiw)
  * A random variable (r.v.) associates a value ( a number) to every possible outcome.
  * Mathematically: A function from the sample space Omega to real numbers.
  * A r.v. can take discrete or continuous values.
  * Notation: Random variable (a function) X, numerical value x.
  * We can have several r.v's defined on the same sample space.
  * A function of one or several random variables is also a random variable.

* [Probability Mass Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La49EMG5Ar4)
  * Also called "probability law" or "probability distribution" of X.
  * P_X (x) = P(X=x) = P({w e omega s.t. X(w) = x}).
  * Properties: P_X (x) >= 0 and Sum_x P_X (x) = 1.

* [Bernoulli and Indicator Random Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vokziIl_3Eo)
  * The simplest kind of r.v.
  * A Bernoulli r.v. with parameter p e [0,1]:
    * X = 1 w.p. p; = 0 w.p. (1-p).
  * It models a trial with success/ failure, heads / tails, etc.
  * Indicator r.v. of event A: I_A = 1 iff A occurs. i.e. P_(I_A) (1) = P(I_A = 1) = P(A).
