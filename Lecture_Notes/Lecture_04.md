* [The Counting Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXFXHfGrCkI)
  * **Basic Counting Principle:** If there are r stages, with ni choices in the ith stage,
  the total number of choices is n1 * n2 * ... *nr.
  * **Permutations:** Number of ways of ordering n elements, denoted by n!
  * Number of subsets possible for a set containing n elements: Each element might be present or absent in the subset - hence 2^n.

* [Combinations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pNcPbGBuFg)
  * **Combinations:** nCk - The number of k-element subsets of a given n-element set.  

  > nCk = n! * (n-k)! / k!
  * Convention: 0! = 1.

* [Binomial Probabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0JZEOZPITo)
  * nCk also called binomial coefficients, and are related to binomial probabilities.
  * Let p the probabilty of getting a head in a toss. 
  Then the probability of getting exactly k heads in a n toss sequence is:  
  (Probability of getting a specific k head sequence) * (Number of k head sequences) =
