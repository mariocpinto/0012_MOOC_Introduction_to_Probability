### Lecture 3: Independence

* [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqr5oANeEI8)

* [Coin Tossing Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4k4ep3lSwc)

* [Independence of Two Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbn_sSLenYk)
  * Intuitive definition: P(B|A) = P(B) { and P(B|A) = P(A) }.
  * Formal definition: Two events are independent iff P(AnB) = P(A)*P(B).
  * Disjoint events are _not_ independent.

* [Independence of Event Complements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvrecTHAWRU)
  * If A and B are independent, so are A and B'.

* [Conditional Independence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXV15izY1dQ)
  * Independence does not imply conditional independence.

* [Independence versus Conditional Independence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac8KiNC0zM0)

* [Independence of a Collection of Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9dtA6VZ8u0)
  * Intutive definition: Information on some of the events does not change the probabilities related to the remaining events.
  * Formal definition: P(AinAjn....Am) = P(Ai) * (PAj) * ... * P(Am) for any distinct indices i,j, ...m.

* [Independence versus Pairwise Independence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsEogLmLcuY)
  * Difference between independence versus pairwise independence explained using a coin toss example.

* [Reliability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQG26uPoCcA)
 * Calculating reliability for a system of independent components.
